Currently a leveling timer has been implemented. More information will be added here as it is devolped.

Currently no translations are available. They will be introduced moving forward.

The available slash commands:

/srGoal (goal level)
Will display the current goal level, if you wish to change the level goal, you can set that by adding the desired level (Ex: "/srGoal 20" would set my goal level to 20).

/srReady
Will begin loading the timer, this MUST be done before runs if they wish to be recognized.

/srStop
Will stop the timer.

/srSplit
Displays the current "split", and where you are at in the run.
